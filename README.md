### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 


My name is Juan, and I'm working towards becoming a Data Analyst after studying a double degree in Business Administration and International Relations at Universidad Pontificia Comillas - ICADE. I'm currrently working at Jobandtalent, one of Spain's fastest growing startups, as a Finance Operations Analyst. I'm looking for the opportunity to develop my professional career as a Data Analyst, using especially Python and SQL. I'm especially interested in cleaning and transforming data to later analyze and extract insightful conclusions that can help a company improve its business. 

I started this journey in October 2020 when I enrolled in Ironhack's bootcamp on Data Analytics, and even though I haven't been working professionally with Python, I have kept developing my own projects to keep polishing the skils I acquired during the bootcamp. Of all the projects I have done so far, I'm especially proud of the following:

    - skills: web scraping, transforming datasets to have proper format, database structuring (MongoDB), visualization
    - libraries: Pandas, Selenium, PyMongo, Numpy, Matplotlyb, Seaborn
